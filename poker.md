- **1: Very Simple Task**
  This represents a task with minimal effort and complexity. Examples include fixing a typo, updating a small piece of text, or making a minor configuration change. It’s straightforward, quick, and requires little thought or coordination.

- **2: Slightly More Involved Task**
  A task that’s still relatively simple but takes a bit more effort than a 1. This could be a small code change, like updating a function or fixing a minor bug. It’s low in complexity but requires some attention to detail.

- **3: Moderate Effort Task**
  This involves a task that needs moderate effort or thought. Examples include adding a small feature, fixing a bug that requires understanding multiple parts of the code, or doing some light research or coordination with team members.

- **5: Noticeably Complex Task**
  A task with some complexity and multiple steps. This might mean designing a small feature, integrating with an external service, or tackling a bug that affects several areas. There’s often a bit of uncertainty or a need for deeper work.

- **8: Significant Task**
  This represents a substantial effort, such as implementing a major feature, refactoring a large section of code, or solving a complex bug with many unknowns. It often requires collaboration across teams or impacts multiple components.

- **13: Large, Complex Task**
  A major undertaking with high complexity and risk. Examples include redesigning a significant part of a system, implementing a new architecture, or developing a feature that spans multiple sprints. It’s a big task with considerable uncertainty.

- **21: Epic-Level Task**
  This is a massive project or overhaul, often too big to tackle in one go. Think of migrating an entire application to a new technology stack or building a new product from scratch. It’s typically broken into smaller tasks but shows the huge scale of the work.
