Previously we had some google pages available publicly, but when google changed to the new version of \"sites\" they prevented us having some pages public so we've only got it as a private page now https://sites.google.com/gigasciencejournal.com/giganet/public-pages/gigadb-user-guide/commenting-on-our-datasets?authuser=0 you need to be logged in with a @gigasciencejournal.com email address to view them.
