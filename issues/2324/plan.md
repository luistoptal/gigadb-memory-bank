### Add "Commenting on Datasets" Help Tab

- [ ] **Create image directory and add optimized images**
      Establishes the location for visual assets (`images/help/commenting/`) and ensures they are web-ready for the new help section.
- [ ] **Add new tab link and content pane structure to `help.php`**
      Implements the basic UI framework in `protected/views/site/help.php` for the new help tab, making it navigable.
- [ ] **Populate "Commenting on Datasets" tab with text and image references in `help.php`**
      Adds the actual informational content (text and linked images) to the newly created tab pane in `protected/views/site/help.php`.
- [ ] **Apply styling adjustments for the new help tab**
      Ensures the new tab and its content visually align with the existing site design by modifying relevant LESS files (e.g., `less/pages/help.less`, `less/modules/tabs.less`).
- [ ] Write or update tests
