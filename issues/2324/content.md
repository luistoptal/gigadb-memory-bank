## Commenting on our datasets

You may have noticed that we do not have a dedicated "User Comments" section in any dataset pages. This is because we utilize the web-tool Hypothes.is. This allows anyone to add comments about any dataset, or indeed any webpage on the internet. It is hoped that this method of annotation will enable a more integrated and potentially more discoverable means of adding useful comments to datasets.

We have installed the Hypothes.is app on all GigaDB.org pages, you will see the option to expand it in the top right-hand corner:

Anyone can see all public comments and highlighted text without the need for an account. However, in order to post a comment on any webpage (including GigaDB pages) using Hypothes.is you will require a Hypothes.is user account. It should be noted that this is different from a GigaDB user account, you are not required to have a GigaDB user account to make comments. Your Hypothes.is account will be maintained by Hypothes.is and we have no control or influence on their policies, terms, or guidelines.

We use the Public commenting system so that all comments are visible to everyone. You may of-cause make use of the Hypothes.is functionality to create your own groups so that you can share you comments privately with other Hypothes.is users in your group.

Hypothes.is have extensive user guides and information on their website, these are just a few that you might find useful:

Its very simple to add a comment to any dataset, simply highlight the word(s) within the page that you wish to make a comment about and a dialog box appears asking if you want to annotate or highlight your selection (see image left).

Select Annotate to add a comment or annotation about the particular word/phrase (see image right). Type your comment then post to Public for everyone to be able to see it. If you wish, you can use hypothes.is app to keep your personal annotations about pages by selecting to post to "only me" instead of public, but no-one else will be able to see them if you do that.

Alternatively, if you wish to simply add a general comment to the page/dataset you can use the "page notes" option, click the "New Page note" button in the top right of the screen:

If a Public comment/annotation has been added to a specific word/phrase in a page by someone you will see it in the text as a yellow highlighted word/phrase as well as a number in the relevant place on the right hand side of the page:

However, Page notes are a little less obvious. If you have the Hypothes.is app installed on your browser then it will notify you of page notes in the usual way, however if you do not have the app installed the only way to see page notes it to Open the webtool on the right hand side:
