# Pull request for issue: #2324

This is a pull request for the following functionalities:

* Add a new "Commenting on Datasets" tab to the Help page (`/site/help`)
* Provide accessible guidance content via new partial `protected/views/site/_help_commenting.php`
* Import and optimise seven explanatory images that illustrate Hypothes.is usage
* Introduce `less/modules/prose.less` and register it in `less/index.less` for consistent article-style typography
* Minor typography fix in `less/modules/titles.less`

## How to test?

1. Run the stack locally (`./up.sh`) and ensure assets are rebuilt (`npm run build` or `./watch-vue.sh`).
2. Visit `http://localhost:8080/site/help` (or the container URL).
3. Verify that a new tab labelled **Commenting on Datasets** appears last in the tab list.
4. Select the tab and check that:
   * All text renders with the new _prose_ styles.
   * Each image is displayed and has descriptive **alt** text.
   * External links open in a new tab and use `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
5. Optional a11y check: run `axe` in the browser dev-tools – no new violations should be reported.

## How have functionalities been implemented?

* **View layer** – `help.php` gains a list item in the nav-tabs and a tab-pane that renders the reusable partial `_help_commenting.php`.
* **Content partial** – `_help_commenting.php` wraps the article in a `<section class="prose">` container and includes semantic headings, paragraphs, images and lists.
* **Styling** – A new SMACSS *module* `prose.less` sets readable line-height, heading scale, list counters and link colours. It is imported from `less/index.less` so it is bundled automatically.
* **Assets** – GIF/PNG screenshots are placed in `images/help/commenting/` and referenced with root-relative paths to avoid extra URL helpers.
* **Accessibility** – All images include informative `alt` text, headings form a logical hierarchy, and list bullets are replaced with custom counters for better consistency.

## Any issues with implementation?

> None identified; build, unit tests and Playwright E2E suite all pass locally.

## Any changes to automated tests?

> TODO: Add Playwright test that asserts presence of the new tab and key content.

## Any changes to documentation?

* This PR _is_ documentation – it adds on-site help content.

## Any technical debt repayment?

* Abstracted long-form content styles into `less/modules/prose.less`, available for future documentation pages.

## Any improvements to CI/CD pipeline?

> None.
