## Additional Info
Previously we had some google pages available publicly, but when google changed to the new version of "sites" they prevented us having some pages public so we've only got it as a private page now: https://sites.google.com/gigasciencejournal.com/giganet/public-pages/gigascience-rrid-list?authuser=0 you need to be logged in with a @gigasciencejournal.com email address to view them.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n0qGBKFiSmxTdRmStwf4T89Guqc9KF4T/view?usp=sharing) is the mhtml version of that page containing the details to be added to gigadb.org help pages.
