# Pull request for issue: #2231

This pull request introduces the following functionalities:

* Adds BlueSky social media link (with new logo icon) to the website's header, footer, and mobile navigation menu so users can follow GigaScience on the emerging platform.
* Updates responsive break-points and component widths in several Less modules to accommodate the additional icon without layout breakage on small and medium screens.
* Adds the BlueSky logo SVG asset to the project and registers it in all relevant views.
* Minor PHP tidy-up: replaces short open tag `<?` with `<?php` in `_topBar.php` to comply with PSR-2.

## How to test?

1. `./up.sh` to start the local stack (or deploy this branch to a preview environment).
2. Visit the site on desktop (`≥992px`), tablet (`768-991px`), and mobile (`<768px`) widths.
3. Verify that the BlueSky icon appears in:
   * Header top bar social list (desktop/tablet)
   * Mobile hamburger navigation social links
   * Footer social links
4. Click the icon – it should open `https://bsky.app/profile/gigascience.bsky.social` in a new tab.
5. Confirm that existing X and Weibo icons are still present and correctly aligned.
6. Run the CSS linter (`npm run lint:less` if configured) and PHPUnit/Codeception suites – they should all pass.

## How have functionalities been implemented?

* **Asset**: `images/icons/bsky-logo.svg` added and referenced by all social link partials.
* **Views**:
  * `_topBar.php`, `_footer.php`, `_mobile_navigation.php` – append a new `<li>` / `<a>` entry with BlueSky link and icon.
  * Replace one shorthand PHP tag for standards compliance.
* **Styles**:
  * Adjust break-points in `basetopbar.less`, `navs.less`, `mobile-nav.less` from `@screen-sm` to `@screen-md/lg` so the new icon fits before collapsing.
  * Increase width of `.search-bar` (292→314 px) and `.share-zone` (200→240 px) to maintain visual balance.
  * Normalise spacing & hover rules in `sharezone.less`; keep SMACSS module boundaries intact.
* **Meta**: Update `CHANGELOG.md` under "Unreleased" with feature note.

## Any issues with implementation?

None observed. Cross-browser checks (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) present no layout regressions. Please flag if you notice any edge-cases on very small devices (<320 px).

## Any changes to automated tests? [optional]

No automated tests added – the change is visual and uses existing view partials. E2E Playwright scenarios rely on generic selectors that remain unaffected.

## Any changes to documentation? [optional]

Not required. Social media docs will be updated in the next docs sweep.

## Any technical debt repayment? [optional]

Replaced short open tag with full PHP tag in `_topBar.php`.

## Any improvements to CI/CD pipeline? [optional]
