What is involved in data curation?
GigaDB biocurators will enhance metadata about your submitted data files by inclusion of a dataset title, author list, description and keywords.  The following actions, checks and enhancements are undertaken during the curation process:
- Check the consistency and completeness of data provided, with respect to the associated manuscript
- Carry out file integrity checks
- Ensure accessibility of data to end users
- Ensure transparency of data files including file descriptions and where appropriate additional metadata.
- Extract sample metadata to be hosted in GigaDB
- Check for presence of sensitive or identifying information
- Check methodology is complete and discoverable
- Recommend appropriate external repositories and appropriate details to include with those data
- Provide assistance with data upload to GigaDB repository (with up to 1TB free storage)
- Organise files into a logical structure and collections
- Content assigned to appropriate SRAO catagories
- A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is generated for each dataset
- Pre-publication embargoes with private, anonymous access can be enabled
- Link and synchronize dataset release to associated publications

Who can use GigaDB's data support services?
The scope of GigaDB is all of the life sciences, so as long as your research is Open, and involves life sciences in some way and is in a state that forms a complete unit-of-work*, then contact us to discuss how we can help. By unit-of-work we just mean something that could be written up a scientific paper, that could be a data-note, technical-note or a research article.

>Q. What's the relationship between GigaScience and GigaDB

Update the Q :
"What's the relationship between GigaScience Press and GigaDB"
Update the answer:
"A. GigaScience Press currently publishes two journal; _[GigaScience](www.gigasciencejournal.com)_ and _[GigaByte](www.gigabytejournal.com)_, as well as one data archive; GigaDB. The GigaDB platform has been created with the intention of hosting all the data associated with articles published in GigaScience Press journals to ensure full transparency and reproducibility of those scientific articles and promote data sharing and data reuse in line with the FAIR sharing prinicples. It should be noted that GigaScience Press is a part of the BGI Group, who provided the start up funding for the journal and GigaDB development."

Q. What is the long term preservation plan for GigaDB?

Update the answer to:

"A. The fact that BGI covers the majority of the costs of running GigaDB means that it will be actively maintained for the foreseeable future. In the longer term, it is envisaged that the article (and/or) data processing charges levied on submitters will cover storage and curation costs to enable the maintenance and sustained growth of GigaDB."

### Issue 477: Update FAQ "How do I download a large dataset with my slow internet connection?"
https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/issues/477

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
rewrite this FAQ as its out of date!

## Currently it looks like this:

Q. How do I download a large dataset with my slow internet connection?
A. There are 2 ways to download data from GigaDB:
FTP. This is the "normal" method, click the download button on any dataset page and this is how your data will be sent.
Hard drive shipment. On occasion when datasets are very large and internet connections are slow, some user may request data to be sent by hard disk, GigaDB cannot bare the cost of this but we will assist in the copy of the data onto the disks and help arrange shipment, but the user will be required to cover the cost of the disks and shipment.

## change it to this:

remove the question and answer entirely
