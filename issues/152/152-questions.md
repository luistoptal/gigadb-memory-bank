1) if a dataset contains many samples and files (100s of entries), should they all be displayed in the simplified view? would it be better to entirely omit the table to avoid overly long pages? I guess there could be pagination, but if the main purpose of the page is to be printed, then I see no point

options that come to mind:

A) show full table (potentially very long)
B) show only first N rows and a link to the full page "see full table"
C) entirely omit table from simplified view

2) about this requirement:

> simplified view of each dataset should be on the URL http://gigadb.org/dataset/100397.rtf

is this a hard requirement? it would be technically simpler to have a normal url like /dataset/simplified/xxxxxx or /dataset/print/xxxxxx, etc
