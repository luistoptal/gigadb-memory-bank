Closes #152

## Description

This pull request introduces a printer-friendly version of the dataset view page. The goal is to provide a clean, simplified layout optimized for printing by removing unnecessary UI elements like the header, footer, navigation, and other interactive components.

A "Print view" toggle button has been added to allow users to switch between the standard and print-optimized modes without a page reload. This improves usability and ensures the printed output is clean, readable, and focused on the essential dataset information.

## Changes Made

### Backend
- **`URLsService.php`**: Added a `editUrlQueryParams()` method to dynamically manage URL query parameters, used for toggling the complete file/sample list in print view.
- **`DatasetPageAssembly.php`**: Updated to detect the print view via URL parameters and adjust pagination accordingly. It now displays up to 100 items by default in print view, with an option to show all results for larger datasets.
- **`dataset/view.php`**: Modified to include a print view toggle, add `data-header` attributes for improved table layouts in print, and conditionally render elements specific to the print view.
- **`layouts/main.php`**: Adjusted to add a `print` class to the `<body>` tag when the print view is active.

### Frontend
- **`_printToggle.php`**: Created a new shared partial that provides the "Print view" / "Web view" toggle button and the associated JavaScript to update the UI and URL.
- **`less/`**:
    - Added `layout/print.less` and `pages/dataset-print.less` to define the styles for the printer-friendly layout.
    - Updated `index.less` to import the new print styles.
    - Scoped existing styles in `pages/dataset.less` to `body:not(.print)` to prevent conflicts with the print view.

## How to Test

1. Navigate to any dataset page (e.g., `/dataset/100001`).
2. Click the "Print view" button located at the top right of the main content area.
3. **Verify**: The URL should update to include `?print=true`. The page layout should change to a simplified format, with the header, footer, and side navigation hidden.
4. **Verify**: The content, including metadata, files, and samples, should be restyled for clarity and readability.
5. Open the browser's print preview (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P).
6. **Verify**: The preview should display a clean, well-formatted document. The files and samples tables should be stacked vertically for better print output.
7. For datasets with more than 100 files or samples, confirm that a "Show all X results" link appears in print view. Clicking it should append `&full=true` to the URL and display all items.
8. Click the "Web view" button.
9. **Verify**: The page should revert to the standard interactive layout, and the `?print=true` parameter should be removed from the URL.
